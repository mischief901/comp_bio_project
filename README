I,unforunately,cannot upload the data and model for everything to run. The
files are too big for both gradescope and github.

To run with the packaged model and data, run: Python3 main.py

Although not recommended, you can also retrain the model by uncommenting the
call to main on line 222 in main.py

Also not recommended, you can reload all the data from their files by
uncommenting the call to main on line 221 in main.py. This requires that all
the files be downloaded from HMDB at http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads
The required docs are:
    'Metabolite Structures' stored in an structures.sdf file
    'MS-MS Spectra Files (XML)' stored in a folder 'predicted_ms_ms_spectra'
